### NASA Space Apps Challenge 23: Develop the Oracle of DSCOVR

## SUMMARY
When operating reliably, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) space weather station, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), can measure the strength and speed of the solar wind in space, which enables us to predict geomagnetic storms that can severely impact important systems like GPS and electrical power grids on Earth. DSCOVR, however, continues to operate past its expected lifetime and produces occasional faults that may themselves be indicators of space weather. The challenge is to use the "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all—to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth. [1]

Here we develop probabilistc machine learning models to forecast planetary K-index, and also use clustering to clean data.

## How you can explore the models:

CLone the project. First, you will need to have ```poetry``` installed on your device. Then, from the project directory:

  poetry install

Now you will have an environment with all dependencies installed.
